   abstract = {Imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease provide valuable information on brain health, but their manual assessment is time-consuming and hampered by substantial intra- and interrater variability. Automated rating may benefit biomedical research, as well as clinical assessment, but diagnostic reliability of existing algorithms is unknown. Here, we present the results of the \textit\{VAscular Lesions DetectiOn and Segmentation\} (\textit\{Where is VALDO?\}) challenge that was run as a satellite event at the international conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Aided Intervention (MICCAI) 2021. This challenge aimed to promote the development of methods for automated detection and segmentation of small and sparse imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease, namely enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) (Task 1), cerebral microbleeds (Task 2) and lacunes of presumed vascular origin (Task 3) while leveraging weak and noisy labels. Overall, 12 teams participated in the challenge proposing solutions for one or more tasks (4 for Task 1 - EPVS, 9 for Task 2 - Microbleeds and 6 for Task 3 - Lacunes). Multi-cohort data was used in both training and evaluation. Results showed a large variability in performance both across teams and across tasks, with promising results notably for Task 1 - EPVS and Task 2 - Microbleeds and not practically useful results yet for Task 3 - Lacunes. It also highlighted the performance inconsistency across cases that may deter use at an individual level, while still proving useful at a population level.},

   abstract = {Nature | www.nature.com | 1 Article Variability in the analysis of a single neuroimaging dataset by many teams Data analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses 1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset 2-5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed. Data analysis workflows in many areas of science have a large number of analysis steps that involve many possible choices (that is, "researcher degrees of freedom" 6,7). Simulation studies show that variability in analytical choices can have substantial effects on results 8 , but its degree and effect in practice is unclear. Recent work in psychology addressed this through a "many analysts" approach 9 , in which the same dataset was analysed by a large number of groups, uncovering substantial variability in behavioural results across analysis teams. In the Neuroim-aging Analysis Replication and Prediction Study (NARPS), we applied a similar approach to the domain of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the analysis workflows of which are complex and highly variable. Our goal was to assess-with the highest possible ecological validity-the degree and effect of analytical flexibility on fMRI results in practice. In addition, we estimated the beliefs of researchers in the field regarding the degree of variability in analysis outcomes using prediction markets to test whether peers in the field could predict the results 2-5 .},

   abstract = {Positive associations between cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and APOE-Îµ4 (apolipoprotein E) genotype have been reported in Alzheimer's disease, but show conflicting results. We investigated the effect of APOE genotype on CMBs in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired middle- and old-aged individuals enriched for APOE-Îµ4 genotype. Participants from ALFA (Alzheimer and Families) cohort were included and their magnetic resonance scans assessed (n = 564, 50% APOE-Îµ4 carriers). Quantitative magnetic resonance analyses included visual ratings, atrophy measures, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) segmentations. The prevalence of CMBs was 17%, increased with age (p < 0.05), and followed an increasing trend paralleling APOE-Îµ4 dose. The number of CMBs was significantly higher in APOE-Îµ4 homozygotes compared to heterozygotes and non-carriers (p < 0.05). This association was driven by lobar CMBs (p < 0.05). CMBs co-localized with WMH (p < 0.05). No associations between CMBs and APOE-Îµ2, gray matter volumes, and cognitive performance were found. Our results suggest that cerebral vessels of APOE-Îµ4 homozygous are more fragile, especially in lobar locations. Co-occurrence of CMBs and WMH suggests that such changes localize in areas with increased vascular vulnerability.},

The relevance of machine learning research can only be improved if we also employ empirical rigor that incorporates reproducibility guidelines, especially so in the medical imaging field. The Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL) conference has made advancements in this direction by advocating open access, and recently also recommending authors to make their code public - both aspects being adopted by the majority of the conference submissions. This helps the reproducibility of the methods, however, there is currently little or no support for further evaluation of these supplementary material, making them vulnerable to poor quality, which affects the impact of the entire submission. We have evaluated all accepted full paper submissions to MIDL between 2018 and 2022 using established, but slightly adjusted guidelines on reproducibility and the quality of the public repositories. The evaluations show that publishing repositories and using public datasets are becoming more popular, which helps traceability, but the quality of the repositories has not improved over the years, leaving room for improvement in every aspect of designing repositories. Merely 22% of all submissions contain a repository that were deemed repeatable using our evaluations. From the commonly encountered issues during the evaluations, we propose a set of guidelines for machine learning-related research for medical imaging applications, adjusted specifically for future submissions to MIDL.},

   abstract = {Increasing evidence shows that flaws in machine learning (ML) algorithm validation are an underestimated global problem. Particularly in automatic biomedical image analysis, chosen performance metrics often do not reflect the domain interest, thus failing to adequately measure scientific progress and hindering translation of ML techniques into practice. To overcome this, our large international expert consortium created Metrics Reloaded, a comprehensive framework guiding researchers in the problem-aware selection of metrics. Following the convergence of ML methodology across application domains, Metrics Reloaded fosters the convergence of validation methodology. The framework was developed in a multi-stage Delphi process and is based on the novel concept of a problem fingerprint - a structured representation of the given problem that captures all aspects that are relevant for metric selection, from the domain interest to the properties of the target structure(s), data set and algorithm output. Based on the problem fingerprint, users are guided through the process of choosing and applying appropriate validation metrics while being made aware of potential pitfalls. Metrics Reloaded targets image analysis problems that can be interpreted as a classification task at image, object or pixel level, namely image-level classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation tasks. To improve the user experience, we implemented the framework in the Metrics Reloaded online tool, which also provides a point of access to explore weaknesses, strengths and specific recommendations for the most common validation metrics. The broad applicability of our framework across domains is demonstrated by an instantiation for various biological and medical image analysis use cases.},

   abstract = {This paper provides the first review to date which gathers, describes, and assesses, to the best of our knowledge, all available publications on automating cerebral microbleed (CMB) detection. It provides insights into the current state of the art and highlights the challenges and opportunities in this topic. By incorporating the best practices identified in this review, we established guidelines for the development of CMB detection systems. We are confident that these guidelines can serve as a foundation for further research. CMB detection is a crucial but challenging task that can be laborious for radiologists. With the increasing popularity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the ability to detect CMBs has improved, but there is still a need to automate this process to enhance its efficiency and accuracy. A high prevalence of CMBs is closely associated with cognitive dysfunction, diabetes, hypertension, an increased risk of stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage. It is alarming to note that strokes, Alzheimer's disease, and Diabetes mellitus have secured their position as the second, seventh, and ninth most common causes of death worldwide, respectively. Moreover, CMBs are sometimes found in association with other pathologies and indicate a range of pathological processes in the cerebral vessels. Thus, it is essential to enhance the quality of diagnostics to facilitate prompt identification and treatment of these potentially life-threatening conditions. In this paper, we aimed to systematize the existing knowledge and best practices in automatic CMB detection, from fundamental information about CMBs and MRI image data, through employed datasets and CMB detection and verification algorithms, to methods of result evaluation. This can serve as a starting point for future research and the development of a CMB detection system that is practically applicable in medicine, leading to enhanced patient treatment outcomes.},

Its fast and robust object detection, segmentation, tracking, and classification of pathophysiological anatomical structures can support medical practitioners during routine clinical workflow. Thus, deep learning-based applications for diseases diagnosis will empower physicians and allow fast decision-making in clinical practice. Highlight: Deep learning can be more robust with various features for differentiating classes, provided the training set is large and diverse for analysis. However, sufficient medical images for training sets are not always available from medical institutions, which is one of the major limitations of deep learning in medical image analysis. This review article presents some solutions for this issue and discusses efforts needed to develop robust deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis applications for better clinical workflow in endoscopy, radiology, pathology, and dentistry. Conclusion: The introduction of deep learning-based applications will enhance the traditional role of medical practitioners in ensuring accurate diagnoses and treatment in terms of precision, reproducibility, and scalability.},

The changes affect arterioles, capillaries and small veins supplying the white matter and deep structures of the brain.

The nomenclature and radiological phenotypes of CSVD were published in 2013 based on the unified position of the so-called Centres of Excellence in Neurodegeneration. The disease is characterized by a diverse clinical and radiological picture. It is primarily responsible for stroke incidents, gait disturbances, depression, cognitive impairment, and dementia in the elderly. The CSVD contributes to about 20% of strokes, including 25% of ischemic strokes and 45% of dementias. Common causes of CSVD include arteriosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), genetic small vessel angiopathy, inflammation and immune-mediated small vessel diseases, and venous collagenosis. There is no causal treatment and management is mainly based on combating known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).},

   abstract = {Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are a recognised biomarker of traumatic axonal injury (TAI). Their number and location provide valuable information in the long-term prognosis of patients who sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Accurate detection of CMBs is necessary for both research and clinical applications. CMBs appear as small hypointense lesions on susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (SWI). Their size and shape vary markedly in cases of TBI. Manual annotation of CMBs is a difficult, error-prone, and time-consuming task. Several studies addressed the detection of CMBs in other neuropathologies with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study, we developed and contrasted a classification (Patch-CNN) and two segmentation (Segmentation-CNN, U-Net) approaches for the detection of CMBs in TBI cases. The models were trained using 45 datasets, and the best models were chosen according to 16 validation sets. Finally, the models were evaluated on 10 TBI and healthy control cases, respectively. Our three models outperform the current status quo in the detection of traumatic CMBs, achieving higher sensitivity at low false positive (FP) counts. Furthermore, using a segmentation approach allows for better precision. The best model, the U-Net, achieves a detection rate of 90% at FP counts of 17.1 in TBI patients and 3.4 in healthy controls.},

   abstract = {Cerebral microbleeds, observed as small, spherical hypointense regions on gradient echo (GRE) or susceptibility weighted (SWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, reflect small hemorrhagic infarcts, and are associated with conditions such as vascular dementia, small vessel disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and Alzheimerâs disease. The current gold standard for detecting and rating cerebral microbleeds in a research context is visual inspection by trained raters, a process that is both time consuming and subject to poor reliability. We present here a novel method to automate microbleed detection on GRE and SWI images. We demonstrate in a community-based cohort of older adults that the method is highly sensitive (greater than 92% of all microbleeds accurately detected) across both modalities, with reasonable precision (fewer than 20 and 10 false positives per scan on GRE and SWI, respectively). We also demonstrate that the algorithm can be used to identify microbleeds over longitudinal scans with a higher level of sensitivity than visual ratings (50% of longitudinal microbleeds correctly labeled by the algorithm, while manual ratings was 30% or lower). Further, the algorithm identifies the anatomical localization of microbleeds based on brain atlases, and greatly reduces time spent completing visual ratings (43% reduction in visual rating time). Our automatic microbleed detection instrument is ideal for implementation in large-scale studies that include cross-sectional and longitudinal scanning, as well as being capable of performing well across multiple commonly used MRI modalities.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are associated with white matter damage, and various neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. CMBs occur as small, circular hypointense lesions on T2*-weighted gradient recalled echo (GRE) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) images, and hyperintense on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) images due to their paramagnetic nature. Accurate automated detection of CMBs would help to determine quantitative imaging biomarkers (e.g., CMB count) on large datasets. In this work, we propose a fully automated, deep learning-based, 3-step algorithm, using structural and anatomical properties of CMBs from any single input image modality (e.g., GRE/SWI/QSM) for their accurate detections. Methods: In our method, the first step consists of an initial candidate detection step that detects CMBs with high sensitivity. In the second step, candidate discrimination step is performed using a knowledge distillation framework, with a multi-tasking teacher network that guides the student network to classify CMB and non-CMB instances in an offline manner. Finally, a morphological clean-up step further reduces false positives using anatomical constraints. We used four datasets consisting of different modalities specified above, acquired using various protocols and with a variety of pathological and demographic characteristics. Results: On cross-validation within datasets, our method achieved a cluster-wise true positive rate (TPR) of over 90% with an average of <2 false positives per subject. The knowledge distillation framework improves the cluster-wise TPR of the student model by 15%. Our method is flexible in terms of the input modality and provides comparable cluster-wise TPR and better cluster-wise precision compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. When evaluating across different datasets, our method showed good generalizability with a cluster-wise TPR >80 % with different modalities. The python implementation of the proposed method is openly available.},

@article{Matsoukas2022,
   abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven software has been developed and become commercially available within the past few years for the detection of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and chronic cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). However, there is currently no systematic review that summarizes all of these tools or provides pooled estimates of their performance. Methods: In this PROSPERO-registered, PRISMA compliant systematic review, we sought to compile and review all MEDLINE and EMBASE published studies that have developed and/or tested AI algorithms for ICH detection on non-contrast CT scans (NCCTs) or MRI scans and CMBs detection on MRI scans. Results: In total, 40 studies described AI algorithms for ICH detection in NCCTs/MRIs and 19 for CMBs detection in MRIs. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 92.06%, 93.54%, and 93.46%, respectively, for ICH detection and 91.6%, 93.9%, and 92.7% for CMBs detection. Some of the challenges encountered in the development of these algorithms include the laborious work of creating large, labeled and balanced datasets, the volumetric nature of the imaging examinations, the fine tuning of the algorithms, and the reduction in false positives. Conclusions: Numerous AI-driven software tools have been developed over the last decade. On average, they are characterized by high performance and expert-level accuracy for the diagnosis of ICH and CMBs. As a result, implementing these tools in clinical practice may improve workflow and act as a failsafe for the detection of such lesions.

@report{Shukla2023,
   abstract = {High-quality labels are often very scarce, whereas unlabeled data with inferred weak labels occurs more naturally. In many cases, these weak labels dictate the frequency of each respective class over a set of instances. In this paper, we develop a unified approach to learning from such weakly-labeled data, which we call count-based weakly-supervised learning. At the heart of our approach is the ability to compute the probability of exactly k out of n outputs being set to true. This computation is differentiable, exact, and efficient. Building upon the previous computation, we derive a count loss penalizing the model for deviations in its distribution from an arithmetic constraint defined over label counts. We evaluate our approach on three common weakly-supervised learning paradigms and observe that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results across all three of the paradigms.},

   abstract = {Large datasets that enable researchers to perform investigations with unprecedented rigor are growing increasingly common in neuroimaging. Due to the simultaneous increasing popularity of open science, these state-of-the-art datasets are more accessible than ever to researchers around the world. While analysis of these samples has pushed the field forward, they pose a new set of challenges that might cause difficulties for novice users. Here we offer practical tips for working with large datasets from the end-userâs perspective. We cover all aspects of the data lifecycle: from what to consider when downloading and storing the data to tips on how to become acquainted with a dataset one did not collect and what to share when communicating results. This manuscript serves as a practical guide one can use when working with large neuroimaging datasets, thus dissolving barriers to scientific discovery.},
