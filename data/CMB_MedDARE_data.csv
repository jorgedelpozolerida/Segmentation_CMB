Intraparenchymally, there are abnormal susceptibility corresponding to multiple punctate hemorrhages at the cerebral gray-white junctions, with relative sparing of the corpus callosum, but with a few scattered punctate hemorrhages within the brainstem, worrisome for diffuse axonal injury. Better seen on the susceptibility weighted SWI sequence is subarachnoid hemorrhage in the posterior fossa as well. In the extra-axial compartments, there is again evidence of bilateral subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage, hemorrhage in the quadrigeminal cistern, as well as a subdural hematoma along the left cerebral convexity and tentorium.

FINDINGS:
Layering T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensities representing subarachnoid hemorrhage are seen in the left frontal, subfrontal lobes and to a lesser extent the right frontal and bilateral posterior parietal lobes, with some interval redistribution. In addition there is evidence of cortical edema suggestive of contusion in the left subfrontal region adjacent to the aforementioned subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There are numerous foci of SWI signal hypointensity some of which are identified in the subcortical white matter or adjacent to the anterior right corpus callosum and as such may represent axonal injuries. Susceptibility artifacts is also seen within the sulci coinciding with the scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulci are stable in size and configuration and without evidence of midline shift.  The basal cisterns and foramen magnum remain patent.
Left-sided maxillofacial fractures are better demonstrated on the prior outside CT studies. There is redemonstration of left convexity scalp soft tissue swelling.

In the extra-axial compartments, there is again evidence of bilateral subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage, hemorrhage in the quadrigeminal cistern, as well as a subdural hematoma along the left cerebral convexity and tentorium.
Midline shift to the right measures approximately 6.7 mm at the level of the foramen of Monroe, grossly stable from the most recent CT. There is no evidence of tonsillar or uncal herniation. The ventricular system is within normal limits in size.

FINDINGS:
Layering T2/FLAIR signal hyperintensities representing subarachnoid hemorrhage are seen in the left frontal, subfrontal lobes and to a lesser extent the right frontal and bilateral posterior parietal lobes, with some interval redistribution.

Susceptibility artifacts is also seen within the sulci coinciding with the scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulci are stable in size and configuration and without evidence of midline shift.  The basal cisterns and foramen magnum remain patent.

Sequence heavy FSE in T1 after intravenous administration of paramagnetic contrast agent (gadolinium). Analysis: Recent intraparenchymatous hemorrhage with a geometric center in the transition between angular gyrus and occipital turns on the lateral surface of the right cerebral hemisphere, with approximate diameters of 2.5 x 1.7 cm. Multiple and numerous low signal punishes in the sequence of magnetic susceptibility with random and bilateral distribution in the parenchyma of the cerebral hemispheres, bridge and the right cerebellum hemisphere, with a predominance of centered regions. Signs of diffuse and bilateral brain volumetric reduction. Multiple oval structures with a high signal in T2 in the centuryfallic regions and in the central portion of the bridge, which represent association between prominent perivascular spaces and sequelae of ischemic gaps. Prominence of liquor spaces in base cistern and medium convexity grooves and fissures, in contrast to the erasure of groove in high convexity. Increased supratorial ventricular system, disproportionate to volumetric reduction. T2/flair hypersignal outbreaks in the deep white substance of cerebral hemispheres, with no expansive effect or diffusion restriction of a microangiopathic nature. Proportional increase in the supratorial ventricular system. Centromedian structures without significant deviations. NABILITY IS NOT CHARACTERIES BY THE PARAMANGNETIC AGENT. Opinion: Recent intrapernchymal hemorrhage with a geometric center in the transition of occipital lobes and parietal rights. Multiple hemosiderin deposition foci with sequelae of petechial bleeding in both brain hemispheres and posterior fossa is associated. Brain volumetric reduction, which is associated with disproportionate increase in the dimensions of the ventricular system. The appearance is not specific, but is described in patients treated with chronic adult hydrocephalus (HPN).
